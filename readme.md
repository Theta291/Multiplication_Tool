# How to use this tool

This tool graphs dots. You can click and drag the grid to move around. To zoom in and out, scroll up and down.

This tool is used to demonstrate the multiplication of complex numbers. Drag the blue dot to the first number you want to multiply, then right click it to lock it in. It will turn green, and a new blue dot will appear. Drag this dot to the second number and right click it to lock it in. the green dot represents the multiple of the first and second numbers and will move accordingly. You can continue doing this for all the numbers you want to multiply.

To reset the graph, right click on the green dot. If the second, moving grid becomes distracting, right click anywhere except a dot to remove it and right click again when you want to bring it back.
